# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration-A-User-Friendly-Tool-Using-Streamlit-and-Plotly

The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain
insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

INTRODUCTION: 
This project is about the India's top UPI transaction PhonePe analysis. This project analyzes the various transactions associated with the users.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project had the following steps of execution as follows:

1. Data extraction: Cloned the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and stored it in a suitable format such as CSV.

2. Data transformation: Used a scripting language such as Python, along with its libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This included cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

3. Database insertion: Used the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a POSTGRESQL database and inserted the transformed data using SQL commands.

4. Dashboard creation: Used the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

5. Data retrieval: Used the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the POSTGRESQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically. Ensured the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.

RESULT:
The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard that displays information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
